- 👋 Hi, I’m @gustavopi (aka Gustavo Pinent)
- 👀 I’m interested in to develop code from the basic and make my own library so I can really learn how things works
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScrip, PHP, C# and Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on libraries to JavaScript for modern browsers but with some backwards compatibility and multilanguage support
- 📫 How to reach me ... humm, I forgot my telex number... just send me a message!
